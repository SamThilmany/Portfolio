Sam Thilmany | Portfolio Webpage
===================

This is the source code of my personal [portfolio website](https://www.sam-thilmany.com).
I had great fun programming it and I hope that it pleases you.

----------


Code
-------------

This website bases on the `Bootstrap` framework and consists of `HTML`, `CSS` and `jQuery` code. The contact form is validated and send by a tiny `PHP` script.

----------

I have programmed this website, as if it was a larger project. This is mainly noticeable in the partitioning of the `PHP` files. You will see that the email address to which the form will be sent is outsourced. For larger projects, this `config.php`-file would contain all the private data such as the database connection, email addresses and such like.

This is very useful in projects that are stored on GitHub, since a simple entry in the `.gitignore`-file is enough to prevent an upload of these private files to GitHub.
